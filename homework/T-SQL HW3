1. In general, why would you even want to join two (or more) tables together?
 This is a good time to think about the nature of relational algebra.
 
 
2. Describe in your own words the output from an inner join.

An inner join applies two logical query processing phases—it applies a Cartesian
product between the two input tables like in a cross join, and then it filters
rows based on a predicate you specify.
3. Describe in your own words the output from an outer join.
4. Describe in your own words the output from an cross join.
5. A convenient mnemonic for remembering the various joins is “Ohio.” 
Why is this true?
6. Give an example of a composite join.
7. What is the diﬀerence between the following two queries? 
The business problem is “How many orders do we have from each customer?”

================first query=============== 
SELECT C.custid,COUNT(*) AS numorders 
 FROM Sales.Customers AS C
 LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.Orders AS O
 ON C.custid = O.custid
 GROUP BY C.custid;
 
 ================second query=============== 
 SELECT C.custid, COUNT(O.orderid) AS numorders 
 FROM Sales.Customers AS C 
 LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.Orders AS O 
 ON C.custid = O.custid 
 GROUP BY C.custid;
 
8. What might be one reason the following query does not return the column custID in this query?
SELECT C.custid, C.companyname, O.orderid, O.orderdate
 FROM Sales.Customers AS C
 LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.Orders AS O
 ON C.custid = O.custid
 WHERE O.orderdate >= ’20160101’;
