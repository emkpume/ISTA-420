1. Declarative programming is when you say what you want, and imperative language is when you say how to get what you want

2.The three categories of command statements are 
a. data definition language e.g. CREATE,ALTER,DROP
b. data manipulation language e.g. SELECT,INSERT,MERGE, DELETE, TRUNCATE
c. data control language e.g. GRANT, REVOKE

3. A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system
The Human Resources database is where transactions relating to payroll processing, position management, time and attendance, 
recruitment, benefits, and other human resources data collection protocols are recorded, stored and retrieved in a variety of ways.

4. SQL uses a three-valued logic: besides true and false, the result of logical expressions can also be unknown.
 SQL's three valued logic is a consequence of supporting null to mark absent data. If a null value affects the result of a logical expression, 
the result is neither true nor false but unknown.

5. To enforce entity integrity, SQL lets you define the PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE specifications.
 A table can only have one primary key, but several unique indexes.
 That is, you can define the PRIMARY KEY specification for one of the candidate keys, and UNIQUE for the rest of them.
   Entity integrity is concerned with ensuring that each row of a table has a unique and non-null primary key value;
 this is the same as saying that each row in a table represents a single instance of the entity type modelled by the table. 
Entity Integrity ensures two properties for primary keys: The primary key for a row is unique; it does not match the primary key of any other row in the table.

6.A REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY is a database concept that is used to build and maintain logical relationships between tables to avoid logical corruption of data. 
Usually, referential integrity is made up of the combination of a primary key and a foreign key.
 SQL Server uses the referential integrity constraint to ensure that data in one table points to data in another tableâ€”and doesn't point to data that doesn't exist. 
SQL Server uses constraints, triggers, rules, and defaults to enforce referential integrity.

7. relation means representation of a set.

8. The first normal form says that the tuples (rows) in the relation (table) must be unique and attributes should be atomic (non divisable). 
If a table truly represents a relation, it is already in first normal form. the table is not in the first normal form.  
the second column has different characters (different degrees that can be separated into different column or tables) that can be separated into another table or column. 

Fac ID ||    facName        ||     facCred
1      ||  Alan Alda        ||     BA, MA
2      ||Bridget, Bardot    ||     BS, MS, PHD
3      ||Casey, Cason       ||     AA, BBA, MBA, DED

      Create Table Faculty (
             FacID int primary key,
             FacFirstName text,
             FacLastName text)

      Create Table Credential (
             CredID int primary key,
             CredType text)

      Create Table FacCred (
             FacID int foreign key,
             CredID int foreign key)

9. The second normal form involves two rules. one rule is that the data must meet the first normal form. 
The second rule addresses the relationship between nonkey and candidate key attributes. 
The table is not in the second normal form. 
OWNER ID ||  pet ID  ||   owner first name ||  owner last name ||  petName   ||   petType
1        ||   1      ||    Dom             ||    Delouise      ||    Rex     ||   German-Shepard
1        ||   2      ||    Dom             ||    Delouise      ||   Lecy     ||    Border-Collie
2        ||   3      ||    Emilio          ||    Estevez       ||   Midnight ||   Persian-Cat

you have two primary key (owner ID and pet ID)and you only need one. 
Every nonkey column depends on the entire primary key. I will break the table into two. 
one with a primary key and the second with a foreign key that is tied to the priamry key.
 the command will look like this

       Create table owner (
             OwnerID int primary key,
             OwnerFirstname text,
             OwnerLastname text)
       
       Create table pet (
              PetID int primary key,
              PetName text,
              PetType text,
              OwnerID int foreign Key)

10. The third normal form has two rules. the data must meet the second normal form and also nonkey attributes must be dependent on candidate keys nontransitively.
one nonkey attributes cannot be dependent on another non key attribute. this table is not in third non form.

ID   || FirstName  ||  LastName  ||     Street             ||    City     || state ||  Zip ||
1    ||  Fred      ||  Flintstone||123 Rock Quarry Rd      || Bedrock     || GA    || 31905||
2    ||  Greta     ||  Garbo     ||456 Starlit Ave         || Paris       || FL    || 30019||
3    ||   Harry    ||  Houdini   ||789 Hidden Glen Lane    || Alcatraz    || CA    || 00000||

every nonkey column is unique and they rely on a primary key. if you know the zip code, you can know the city and state. 
if somebody moves, you will have to change the city, state and zip code. 
I will create another table with the zip code being the primary key and the city and state being the non key column.

11. They are  a.Encapsulation
              b. Data Abstraction 
              c. Polymorphism 
              d. Inheritance. 
These are also called as four pillars of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

12.Declarative Data integrity is enforced within the database using constraint, rules, and defaults. 
This is the preferred method of enforcing integrity as it has low overhead and is programmatically simple. 
it is more centrally managed and consistently enforced because it resides in the database.
procedural data integrity is enforced with stored procedures, triggers, and application code. 
procedural integrity generally has a higher overhead and can be quite complex, but it can enforce far more extensive business rule than declarative integrity. 
it should be implemented to complement but not replace, declarative integrity.
