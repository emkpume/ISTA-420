1. What is a table expression? Can you give a technical definition of a table expression?

A table expression is a named query expression that represents a valid relational table. 
You can use able expressions in data-manipulation statements much like you use other
 tables. T-SQL supports our types of table expressions: derived tables, common table 
 expressions (CTEs), views, and inline able-valued functions (inline TVFs).
 
2. In what SQL clause are derived tables (table valued subqueries) located?

Derived tables (also known as table subqueries) are defined in the FROM clause
 of an outer query. Their scope of existence is the outer query. As soon as the outer 
 query is finished, the derived table is gone.
 
3. Why can you refer to column aliases in an outer query that you defined in 
an inner table valued subquery ?

One of the benefits of using table expressions is that, in any clause of the outer query,
 you can refer to olumn aliases that were assigned in the SELECT clause of the inner query.
 This behavior helps you get round the fact that you canâ€™t refer to column aliases assigned 
 in the SELECT clause in query clauses hat are logically processed prior to the SELECT clause 
 (for example, WHERE or GROUP BY).
 
4. What SQL key word defines a common table expression?

Common table expressions (CTEs) are another standard form of table expression similar to derived
tables, yet with a couple of important advantages.
CTEs are defined by using a WITH statement and have the following general form:
WITH<CTE_Name>[(<target_column_list>)]
AS
(
<inner_query_defining_CTE>
)
<outer_query_against_CTE>;

5. When using common table expressions, can a subsequent derived table use a table alias declared in a
preceding table expression?
6. Can a main query refer to a previously defined common table expression by multiple aliases?
7. In SQL, is a view a durable object?
8. In a view, what does WITH CHECK OPTION do? Why is this important?
9. In a view, what does SCHEMABINDING do? Why is this important?
10. What is a table valued function?
11. What does the APPLY operator do?
12. What are the two forms of the APPLY operator? Give an example of each.
