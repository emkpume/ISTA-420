1. List the date/time types in T-SQL.

T-SQL supports six date and time data types:
two legacy types called DATETIME and SMALLDATETIME, and
four later additions called DATE, TIME, DATETIME2, and DATETIMEOFFSET.

2. How do you express a date/time literal in T-SQL?

When you need to specify a literal (constant) of a date and time data type,
 you should consider several things
 (a).  T-SQL doesn’t provide the means to express a date and time literal; instead,
 you can specify a literal of a different type that can be converted—explicitly or 
 implicitly.
 (b). Another option is to use the PARSE function. By using this function, you can
 parse a value as a requested type and indicate the culture.
 (c) use a strig Format.
 
3. What is the setting DATEFORMAT used for?

The DATEFORMAT setting may interpret character strings differently for date data types,
 depending on their string format.
 
4. Wriite a T-SQL snippet changing the date format to German.
 Read the documentation on how to do this.
 
 a. To explicitly specify that a date should be displayed in German format, 
 use de-de as the third argument.
 DECLARE @thedate date = '2020-12-01'
SELECT FORMAT(@thedate, 'd', 'de-de') Result;
 b. You can change the second argument to an uppercase D to result in a longer
 date format, with the month spelled out:
 DECLARE @thedate date = '2020-12-01'
SELECT FORMAT(@thedate, 'D', 'de-de') Result;
 c.You can also use a custom date format if required. This allows you to 
 explicitly state exactly how and where each date component goes.
 DECLARE @thedate date = '2020-12-01'
SELECT FORMAT(@thedate, 'ddd, d. MMM, yyyy', 'de-de') Result;  
 
5. What is the diﬀerence between CAST(), CONVERT(), and PARSE()?

The CAST, CONVERT, and PARSE functions are used to convert an input value 
to some target type. If the conversion succeeds, the functions return the
 converted value; otherwise, they cause the query to fail. The three functions
 have counterparts called TRY_CAST, TRY_CONVERT, and TRY_PARSE, respectively.
 Each version with the prefix TRY_ accepts the same input as its counterpart
 and applies the same conversion; the difference is that if the input isn’t
 convertible to the target type, the function returns a NULL instead of failing
 the query.
 the following are examples of how we use the three.
 SELECT CAST(SYSDATETIME() AS TIME);
 SELECT CONVERT(DATETIME, CONVERT(CHAR(8), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 112), 112);
 SELECT CONVERT(CHAR(12), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 114);
 SELECT PARSE('02/12/2016' AS DATETIME USING 'en-US');
 SELECT PARSE('02/12/2016' AS DATETIME USING 'en-GB');
 


6. What function returns the current date? This is very useful in a table
 that maintains a log of events, such as user logins.
 
 GETDATE();
 
7. How do you add one day to the current date? Add one week? Add one month? Add one year?
DATEADD(<Unit of time>, <Units>, <Date>)
eg. DATEDAY(DAY, 1, '01/27/2020'); OR select DateAdd(day, 1, GetDate());
SELECT DATEADD(WEEK,1,@Date);
SELECT DATEADD(MM,1,@Date);
SELECT DATEADD(YYYY,1,@Date);


8. Write a SQL snippet to return the number of years between your birth date and today’s date.

select DateDiff(d,'1988-09-03', getDate());
select (julianDay

9. How do you check a string literal to see if it represents a valid date?

select IsDate('1988-03-09');

10. What does EOMONTH() do? Give an example of why this might be very useful.

use to display the last day of the given period. 
it keep us from having to know how many days in a month.

The EOMONTH Function is categorized under Excel Date/Time functions. 
The function helps to calculate the last day of the month after adding 
a specified number of months to a date.

11. Payments are due exactly 30 days from the date of the last function. Write a select query that
 calculates the date of the next payment. Pretend we want to update a column in a database that
 contains the date of the next payment. We will do this when we write UPDATE queries.
12. Suppose your son or daughter wants to run a query every day that tells them the number of days until their 16th birthday. Write a select query that does this.
