1. In your own words, what is a subquery?

A subquery is a parenthesized query enclosed within some outer SQL
statement. Most queries are SELECTs, so this means that a subquery
usually takes the form (SELECT ...), nested somewhere inside an expression.
Queries return result sets, or Tables, and the values in such Tables can be
used when the syntax of the outer expression calls for a value of the
appropriate <data type>.
e.g PROMPT, WHERE, GROUP, HAVING, ORDER BY
the three types of subquery are scalar value subquery, list value subquery and
table value subquery.

2. In your own words, what is a self-contained subquery ?

Subqueries is a feature where you want one query to operate on the
result of another query. Subqueries are either self-contained or correlated.
A self-contained subquery is independent of the outer query. 
A scalar subquery returns a single value.
in a self-query, you can run it completely by itself.

3. In your own words, what is a correlated subquery?

SQL Correlated Subqueries are used to select data from a table referenced
in the outer query. The subquery is known as a correlated because the 
subquery is related to the outer query.
you cannot run it by itself because it depends on the outer query.

4. Give an example of a subquery that returns a single value.
 When would you use this kind of subquery?
 
 Introducing a subquery with one of the six comparison operators
(=, <>, <,<=, >, >=) is often useful. In such a case, the SQL expression
preceding the operator evaluates to a single value, and the subquery 
following the operator must also evaluate to a single value.

5. Give an example of a subquery that returns multiple values.
When would you use this kind of subquery?

Multiple row subquery returns one or more rows to the outer SQL statement.
You may use the IN, ANY, SOME, EXIST or ALL operator in outer query to handle a subquery
that returns multiple rows.
list value sub querries returns a column from a table.

6. Give an example of a subquery that returns table values.
 When would you use this kind of subquery?
 
 A table subquery returns a table of one or more rows of one or more columns.
 i will use a table value sub queries when i want to return a table column.
 
7. What does the exists predicate do? Give an example.

The EXISTS predicate evaluates to TRUE providing the subquery contains any rows,
otherwise it evaluates to FALSE. ... This predicate does not evaluate to UNKNOWN.
As in our case, the EXISTS predicate is generally used with correlated subqueries.
That subquery type has an outer reference to the value in the main query.

8. What happens if we use the not operator before a predicate? 
Give an example.


You can invert the sense of a predicate by placing the NOT unary operator before
the predicate. The NOT unary operator only affects the predicate that immediately
follows it. Predicates are evaluated in strict left-to-right order.

9. When you use exists or not exists with respect to a row in a database,
 does it return two or three values? Explain your answer.
 
The EXISTS and NOT EXISTS operators merely test whether a subquery returns any rows.
If it does, EXISTS is true and NOT EXISTS is false. The following statements show
some trivial examples of these subqueries.
The first returns 0 if the absence table is empty, the second returns 1:

SELECT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM absence);
SELECT NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM absence);

10. How would you use a subquery to calculate aggregates? For example, 
you want to calculate yearly sales of a product, and you also want to 
keep a running sum of total sales. Explain how you would use
a subquery to do this.

The aggregate function is a Functions that evaluate all of the values of a column
and return a single aggregate value.With the subquery approach, the aggregate is 
calculated in the inner branch of the join, per each outer row separately. e.g. 
SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, VARIANCE, VAR_SAMP, VAR_POP, STDDEV, STDDEV_SAMP,
 STDDEV_POP â€”, LIST, %DLIST
